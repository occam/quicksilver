B5X is an abandoned branch of Quicksilver.
... it is also the currently released branch.

This branch is a mess, and trunk is intended to clean it up for the future.
B5X compatibility for plug-ins may not continue for long.

We ask that all major patches be applied to trunk, but we will accept changes to B5X for major issues.
To discourage use of this branch, the xcodeproj is not included, but is available on request.
