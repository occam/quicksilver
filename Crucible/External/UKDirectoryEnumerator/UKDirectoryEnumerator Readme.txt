LICENSE:

commercial products free of charge, however distributing modified copies
requires that you clearly mark them as having been modified by you, while
maintaining the original markings and copyrights. I don't like getting bug
reports about code I wasn't involved in.

I'd also appreciate if you gave credit in your app's about screen or a similar
place. A simple "Thanks to M. Uli Kusterer" is quite sufficient.
Also, I rarely turn down any postcards, gifts, complementary copies of
applications etc.

REVISION HISTORY:

0.1 - Initial public release.
0.2 - Fixed some comments. Equivalent to SVN revision 79.
0.3 - Factory methods, category on NSFileManager to get/set Carbon file attributes, basically turned this into an FSCatalogInfo wrapper.
