UKIdleTimer 0.1


WHAT IS IT?

It is a wrapper around the Carbon EventLoopIdleTimer, intended to be used just like an NSTimer. An Idle Timer doesn't trigger until the user has been idle for a while, doing nothing in the GUI.

I'd be interested in any changes you make to this code.

commercial products free of charge, however distributing modified copies
requires that you clearly mark them as having been modified by you, while
maintaining the original markings and copyrights. I don't like getting bug
reports about code I wasn't involved in.

I'd also appreciate if you gave credit in your app's about screen or a similar
place. A simple "Thanks to M. Uli Kusterer" is quite sufficient.
Also, I rarely turn down any postcards, gifts, complementary copies of
applications etc.


DIRECTIONS:

Currently, only the source code comments exist to give directions.
